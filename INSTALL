To compile and install FCEUX for SDL, follow the instructions in the README-SDL.md file.

Users of Microsoft Visual Studio can use the solution files within the vc directory. The Windows XP toolset is required to open and build this solution. If it
is not installed, go to "Tools" > "Get Tools and Features". Select "Individual Components" and then install "C++ Windows XP Support for VS 2017 (v141) tools".
These solution files will compile FCEUX and some included libraries for full functionality.

CMake has been depreciated in favor of scons.  However, if you wish to use it you can find the old cmake build files in the attic.
