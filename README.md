# fceux [![Build status](https://ci.appveyor.com/api/projects/status/github/TASVideos/fceux?branch=master&svg=true)](https://ci.appveyor.com/project/zeromus/fceux)

An open source NES Emulator for Windows and Unix that features solid emulation accuracy and state of the art tools for power users. For some reason casual gamers use it too.

## Builds and Releases

win32 autobuilds are available on [AppVeyor](https://ci.appveyor.com/project/zeromus/fceux/build/artifacts), but you might like [mesen](https://github.com/SourMesen/Mesen) more. 

You should get releases from [SourceForge](https://sourceforge.net/projects/fceultra/files/). That's because GitHub forces us to use tags we don't have for releases. 2.2.3 is the most recent release but autobuilds are typically preferred.
